			<p>Hmmm... It seems that you have taken a wrong turn.  You find 
				yourself staring down a long black corridor that is empty except for 
				a pair of beady, yellow eyes at the far end.  You hear a low, 
				menacing growl coming from the creature that wears those eyes.  You'd 
				better turn around and go the right direction now...</p>
