Title: Beating Conventional Light Microscopy: Two Super Resolution Imaging Techniques

Subtitle: Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) & Cryo-Electron Tomography (CryoET)


Abstract: It has long been established that conventional light
microscopy is limited in resolution to about 200 nm. Many biological
structures, however, are much smaller than 200 nm and cannot be imaged
by conventional microscopes.  STORM takes advantage of labeled
fluorescent proteins that can be individually tracked and used to
reconstruct images with a resolution in the tens of nanometers. CryoET
uses cryo-freezing rather than the traditional method of preparing
samples for electron microscopy, allowing samples to be imaged in
their native states and with a resolution of up to 2 nm.

Magnetoresistance in Ag2Te and Ag2Se thin films

Previous studies have found that Ag2Te and Ag2Se thin films possess a
large positive magnetoresistance. Our preliminary research with these
materials suggests that the surface state effects are significant even
in bulk and poly crystal forms at room temperature. If this is the
case, Ag2Te and Ag2Se would be practical materials for commercial
applications, particularly thermoelectrics. Therefore, we are creating
thin films on silicon dioxide crystals to minimize the bulk
contributions. The thin films are being created in a vacuum chamber
through evaporation deposition. After verifying that the films are
Ag2Te and Ag2Se with an electron microscope, we will test their
magnetoresistance.

Title: A Monte Carlo Study of a Level II Trigger Cut for the K0TO 
Experiment

Abstract: The K0TO experiment is a high energy physics experiment at a
particle accelerator in Japan that will study a rare kaon decay. In
order to accommodate the high kaon flux, the data acquisition system
must quickly discard a high percentage of background events while
retaining all signal events. Monte Carlo simulations show that we can
effectively separate background and signal events by checking the
center of energy radius of incoming events.

Pulsar Science: Arecibo 327 MHz Drift Scan Processing
West Virginia University

Maura McLaughlin – Advisor

Pulsars are the extremely dense remnants of stellar cores that have
survived supernovaexplosions.  As they rotate, they emit pulses of
radiation. For the past nine years, WVUastronomers have conducted a
drift scan using the 305-meter radio telescope at the Arecibo
Observatory. This project is part of an effort to process the radio
data that was collected, in order to find new pulsars and to test
hypotheses about previously known pulsars. Software was developed and
used to isolate pieces of radio data for individual pulsars and pulsar
candidates.This isolated data were processed by folding the data at
the pulsars' period, in order to reveal the flux densities, or
luminosities, of the known pulsars at the survey frequency of 327
MHz. It is hypothesized that the flux densities at 327 MHz will match
those predicted by a model based on the known flux densities at 1400
MHz. The results of this experiment allowed us to calibrate the survey
sensitivity.

Understanding cloud processes represents a cornerstone of the NASA
Earth Science Mission. Sophisticated remote sensing satellites in the
A-Train constellation monitor cloud structure and microphysical
properties on a global scale. Decades of these observations aid in the
development of parameterizations for climate models to help understand
variability in the atmosphere. Despite the complexities of these
tools, a poor understanding of microphysical cloud processes limits
the fidelity of climate and weather models at all scales. Our efforts
are aimed at better understanding the phase transitions of supercooled
cloud droplets, which can initiate precipitation processes and drive
cloud turbulent mixing through the release of latent heat. The
nucleation of these droplets in the lower troposphere is dominated by
the heterogeneous mode due to the abundance of natural and
anthropogenic aerosol catalyst particles. Disentangling complex
droplet-aerosol interactions in the laboratory is important for
correct parameterization in cloud microphysical models.

Heterogeneous nucleation is further complicated by the various
mechanisms in which individual aerosol particles may induce
crystallization. The relevant roles of the two primary pathways,
aerosol-droplet contact (contact mode) and nucleation by an immersed
aerosol (immersion mode), remains an open question. An interpretation
of the difference between the contact and immersion modes is based on
the energy barrier for nucleation at a three-phase and two-phase
interface, respectively. Previous laboratory experiments have noted a
preference for nucleation in the contact mode, with freezing
temperatures 2-5K warmer than in the immersion mode. Contact
nucleation remains enigmatic and our approach utilizes simple
experiments to disentangle several competing hypothesizes. We employ
high speed imaging of supercooled water drops, to determine nucleation
site spatial statistics on the droplet-substrate plane. To that end,
the focus of our initial study was droplets in a spherical cap
geometry resting on homogeneous and atomically smooth silicon
substrates. Radial distributions of the nucleation sites in these
slowly cooled systems revealed no preference for nucleation at the
three-phase contact line, a surprising null result [1].

One hypothesis for this conflicting observation is the presence of a
thermal gradient within droplets experiencing differential cooling,
which can be induced by rapid cooling in cloud updrafts. Our initial
experiment was designed to limit this effect, but here we report on
the modification of our experiment to examine these parameters in more
detail. Initial results with this apparatus agree with our previous
observations suggesting that the lower energy barrier to nucleation in
some contact studies may result from a nanometer scale “point-like”
interaction. It remains unclear to what extent morphology, texture and
size influence the nucleation rate in other non-idealized systems.

Title: "An Analysis Of The Effects Of Massive Rotating Bodies On Orbits In The Weak Field"

Abstract: "Newtonian theories of gravity fail to describe certain
minute but detectable phenomena. The existence of such phenomena
spurred the development of improved theories of gravitation, the most
popular of which is general relativity. This project involved
mathematical examination of various implications of general
relativity, including the perihelion precession of orbits, de Sitter
precession, and Lense-Thirring precession. Expressions for the first
two quantities were derived using the Schwarzschild metric, while the
Lense-Thirring precession was derived using a low angular momentum
limit of the Kerr metric.”

Characterization of an Ion Gun for Use on Extraterrestrial Projects

The EMU Plasma Lab ion gun, built by graduate students, is a tool that
produces a beam of positively charged particles. Once the gun is
characterized, it can be used to model solar wind and how high-speed
solar wind particles sputter solid materials from the surface of
various rocks, which is a process that is interesting to NASA in the
study of such interactions on Mercury. Characterization of the beam
includes measurement of the beam energy, current, diameter, and
intensity profile. The construction and design of a Faraday probe,
which will be used to analyze the ion beam, as well as the operation
of, and applications for, the ion gun will also be explored.

High Altitude Balloon Project

A High Altitude Balloon (HAB)project requires designing, building,
testing, and launching a high altitude balloon.  The HAB provides a
platform to measure the temperature, pressure, and humidity of the
atmosphere during the flight of the balloon.  The project will include
the measurement of acceleration and position in order to determine the
location of different regions of the atmosphere, including the
location of the tropopause.  Video and picture taking capabilities
will be included on the payload in order to record the voyage.  This
project is expected to yield data relevant to issues concerning
weather, atmospheric conditions, and to serve as an introductory
exploration of near space.

Proof of Concept for a Simple Smartphone Sky Monitor

We present a novel approach of obtaining a cloud and bright sky
monitor by using a standard smartphone with a downloadable app. The
addition of an inexpensive fisheye lens can extend the angular range
to the entire sky visible above the device. A preliminary proof of
concept image shows an optical limit of about visual magnitude 5 for a
70-second exposure. Support science objectives include cloud
monitoring in a manner similar to the more expensive cloud monitors in
use at most major astronomical observatories, making expensive
observing time at these observatories more efficient. Primary science
objectives include bright meteor tracking, bright comet tracking, and
monitoring the variability of bright stars. Citizen science objectives
include crowd sourcing of many networked sky monitoring smartphones
typically in broader support of many of the primary science goals. The
deployment of a citizen smartphone array in an active science mode
could leverage the sky monitoring data infrastructure to track other
non-visual science opportunities, including monitoring the Earth's
magnetic field for the effects of solar flares and exhaustive surface
coverage for strong seismic events.
